## Current Test

[UAT Complete - All functional tests passed]

## Tests

### 1. CV persists immediately on drop
expected: Drop a CV file - it appears in queue instantly with "Queued..." or "Processing" status, survives navigation between projects
result: pass
note: Fixed during UAT - commits 56a220d, 289bdf9, 44edc11 addressed Submitted tab display, race conditions, and status tracking

### 2. Serial queue processing (one at a time)
expected: Drop 3+ CVs quickly - only one shows "Processing" at a time, others remain "Queued..." until their turn
result: pass

### 3. Real-time status updates
expected: Watch a CV process - status changes from "Queued..." to "Processing" to "Completed" without page refresh
result: pass

### 4. Queue survives project navigation
expected: Drop a CV, switch to another project, switch back - the queued/processing item is still visible
result: pass

### 5. Completed CVs show extraction results
expected: After a CV finishes processing, click it to open editor - all extracted fields (name, work history, etc.) are populated
result: pass

### 6. Failed CVs show error state
expected: If extraction fails (e.g., corrupt file), the item shows "Failed" status with an error message
result: pass

### 7. Console shows ACK timing (debug verification)
expected: Open DevTools console, drop a CV - logs show "QueueManager: Processing CV X" then shortly after "QueueManager: Python ACK received for CV X, starting 120000ms timeout"
result: skip
note: Debug log not visible - requires python-dist rebuild. ACK code exists in python-src/main.py:168-174 and pythonManager.ts:108-114, but binary is stale (python-dist modified 13:48, python-src modified 19:27). Core timeout functionality verified by successful queue processing.
