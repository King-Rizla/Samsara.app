# Phase 4.5: Project Homepage & Organization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Enable multi-project workflow where recruiters can separate work by job role/client. Add a dashboard homepage with project organization. The existing queue/editor UI remains unchanged inside projects — this phase wraps that in a project container.

## Implementation Decisions

### Homepage Layout
- Sidebar navigation: dark theme, ~200px wide, collapsible to icons-only
- Minimal nav items: Dashboard, Projects, Settings
- Top stats strip: horizontal row of metric cards (CVs processed, time saved, tokens/money spent)
- Time saved calculation: processing delta (actual time vs industry average, e.g., "2s vs 5 min")
- Project cards grid: 3 columns, white rounded cards
- Card content (basic): project name, CV count, JD count, last activity date
- Reference style: PlanRadar dashboard layout

### Project Creation
- Quick inline: "+" card in the grid, click to create
- Required field: project name only
- Optional fields: client name, description
- No templates — every project starts blank
- Both archive and delete options available (archive = hidden/recoverable, delete = permanent)

### Project Switching
- Back to dashboard navigation (click sidebar → dashboard → select project)
- No dropdown switcher or keyboard shortcuts
- Auto-save always — no unsaved state warnings when navigating away
- No recent projects quick access in sidebar

### Data Organization
- CVs isolated to their project (no cross-project sharing)
- Multiple JDs can be added to same project for matching against same CV pool
- Project deletion = delete all CVs, JDs, and match results (permanent, no orphaning)
- Current queue/editor design unchanged inside projects
- Dashboard shows aggregate stats across all projects
- Project view shows project-specific stats

### Claude's Discretion
- How current project is identified when inside a project (header title, breadcrumb, or sidebar)
- Stats strip styling and exact metrics layout
- Project card hover/interaction states
- Sidebar collapse animation and icon states

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "PlanRadar dashboard layout" — sidebar + top stats strip + project cards grid pattern
- Homepage will be the main entry point for future features (business development, etc.)
- Data lifecycle: scrape → analyze → call → schedule → ATS → delete from Samsara
- Usage/billing tracking mentioned as important — accurate token/money spent tracking for charging users

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Call recording feature — future phase
- Interview scheduling — future phase
- ATS integration for data export — future phase
- Business development support features — future phase
- Detailed usage/billing tracking system — needs own phase for accuracy requirements

</deferred>
