# Phase 4.5: Project Homepage & Organization Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Enable multi-project workflow where recruiters can separate work by job role/client
**Verified:** 2026-01-27T14:40:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No - initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User sees a homepage listing all projects on app launch | VERIFIED | Dashboard route renders project list from getAllProjects IPC, StatsStrip shows aggregate stats |
| 2 | User can create a new project with a name and optional description | VERIFIED | CreateProjectDialog captures name/client/description, calls createProject IPC, navigates to new project |
| 3 | Each project contains its own CVs, JDs, and match results (fully isolated) | VERIFIED | Database has project_id on cvs/job_descriptions, getAllCVs/getAllJDs filter by projectId, Default Project migrates orphaned data |
| 4 | User can switch between projects without losing context | VERIFIED | ProjectView useEffect reloads CVs/JDs when projectId changes, queueStore/jdStore read activeProjectId via getState() |
| 5 | Current queue/editor UI works within the selected project scope | VERIFIED | ProjectView wraps QueueTabs/CVEditor/JDPanel with project header, queueStore.loadFromDatabase filters by activeProjectId |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| src/main/database.ts | Schema migration, projects table, project CRUD | VERIFIED | 903 lines, migration v1 (209-256), CRUD functions (762-902) |
| src/main/index.ts | IPC handlers for project operations | VERIFIED | 6 project handlers + projectId params on CV/JD handlers |
| src/main/preload.ts | Renderer API for project operations | VERIFIED | Exposes 6 project methods via contextBridge |
| src/renderer/stores/projectStore.ts | Project state management | VERIFIED | 82 lines, Zustand store with all CRUD actions |
| src/renderer/routes/Dashboard.tsx | Homepage with project list | VERIFIED | 98 lines, renders stats/cards/dialog |
| src/renderer/routes/ProjectView.tsx | Project-scoped queue/JD/editor | VERIFIED | 114 lines, reloads data on project change |
| src/renderer/components/sidebar/AppSidebar.tsx | Collapsible sidebar | VERIFIED | 67 lines, navigation with icon mode |
| src/renderer/components/dashboard/StatsStrip.tsx | Aggregate metrics | VERIFIED | 32 lines, 3 stat cards |
| src/renderer/components/dashboard/ProjectCard.tsx | Project card | VERIFIED | 75 lines, nav + archive/delete |
| src/renderer/components/dashboard/CreateProjectDialog.tsx | Creation modal | VERIFIED | 103 lines, form with validation |
| src/renderer/App.tsx | React Router setup | VERIFIED | 30 lines, MemoryRouter with 2 routes |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | projectStore | loadProjects useEffect | WIRED | Calls loadProjects, updates state |
| CreateProjectDialog | IPC | window.api.createProject | WIRED | Preload invokes, handler creates project |
| ProjectView | queueStore | useEffect reload | WIRED | Triggers loadFromDatabase on projectId change |
| queueStore | activeProjectId | getState() | WIRED | Reads activeProjectId, passes to getAllCVs |
| jdStore | activeProjectId | getState() | WIRED | Reads activeProjectId, passes to getAllJDs |
| cvs.project_id | projects.id | Foreign key | WIRED | Migration adds column, index, default value |
| job_descriptions.project_id | projects.id | Foreign key | WIRED | Migration adds column, index, default value |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. All components substantive, no TODOs, no stubs, no empty handlers.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Visual Dashboard Layout
**Test:** Launch app, observe dashboard
**Expected:** Sidebar, stats strip, project grid, dark theme
**Why human:** Visual appearance, layout correctness

#### 2. Create Project Flow
**Test:** Click + card, enter name/client, create
**Expected:** Dialog opens, validates, navigates to new project
**Why human:** Full UX flow, form validation

#### 3. Project Isolation
**Test:** Upload CV to project A, switch to project B, verify CV not visible
**Expected:** CVs fully isolated per project
**Why human:** Data isolation across navigation

#### 4. Sidebar Collapse
**Test:** Click hamburger, observe collapse
**Expected:** Icon-only mode, tooltips appear
**Why human:** Animation, tooltip behavior

#### 5. Project Actions
**Test:** Archive/delete project from card menu
**Expected:** Project removed from grid, data deleted
**Why human:** Dropdown interaction, confirmation

## Verification Methodology

**Database Schema:** projects table exists (213-223), migration v1 (209-256), CRUD (762-902), 903 lines total

**IPC Layer:** 6 project handlers verified via grep, projectId params added to CV/JD handlers (159, 374)

**UI Components:** All 10 components exist with adequate line counts, no stubs, proper exports

**State Management:** projectStore (82 lines) wired to queueStore (176) and jdStore (44) via getState()

**Build:** npm run package succeeds, no TypeScript errors, Vite bundles correctly
