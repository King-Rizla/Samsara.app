# Phase 4.5: Project Homepage & Organization - UAT Session

## Tests

### Test 1: Dashboard loads on app launch
**Source:** Plan 01/03 - Project store and routing
**Steps:**
1. Launch the app with `npm start`
2. Observe the initial screen

**Expected:** Dashboard appears with sidebar, stats strip, and project grid. "Default Project" card visible (auto-created for existing data).

**Result:** PASS

**User Feedback:** Suggestion for future enhancement - allow drag-and-drop of projects onto sidebar to pin them under "DASHBOARD" for quick access.

### Test 2: Stats strip shows correct metrics
**Source:** Plan 04 - StatsStrip component
**Steps:**
1. View the stats strip at top of dashboard

**Expected:** Three stat cards showing "CVs Processed", "Job Descriptions", and "Time Saved" with aggregate counts from all projects.

**Result:** PASS

---

### Test 3: Create new project flow
**Source:** Plan 04 - CreateProjectDialog
**Steps:**
1. Click the "+" New Project card (dashed border)
2. Enter project name (required field)
3. Optionally enter client name and description
4. Submit the form

**Expected:** Dialog opens, form validates name is required, on submit navigates to the new project view.

**Result:** PASS

---

### Test 4: Project card displays info and actions
**Source:** Plan 04 - ProjectCard component
**Steps:**
1. Look at an existing project card
2. Click the dropdown menu (three dots or similar)

**Expected:** Card shows project name, client name, CV/JD counts, last activity. Dropdown shows Archive and Delete options.

**Result:** PASS

---

### Test 5: Navigate to project view
**Source:** Plan 03 - React Router navigation
**Steps:**
1. Click on a project card

**Expected:** Navigates to /project/:id route, shows project-specific queue/JD/editor UI with project header.

**Result:** PASS

---

### Test 6: Project isolation - CVs scoped to project
**Source:** Plan 01/03 - Project filtering
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to a project
2. Upload a CV to this project
3. Navigate back to dashboard
4. Navigate to a different project

**Expected:** CV only appears in the project where it was uploaded, not in other projects.

**Result:** PASS (with minor UX note)

**Issue Fixed:**
- Root cause: `insertCV` and `insertJD` weren't receiving `projectId` parameter
- Fixed in: database.ts, index.ts, preload.ts, DropZone.tsx, jdStore.ts, queueStore.ts
- CVs and JDs now correctly persist with project association

**Follow-up Required - Submitted Tab Persistence:**
- In-progress items in "Submitted" tab disappear during navigation (they exist only in memory until completion)
- Items reappear in "Completed" tab once processing finishes, but UX is confusing
- **Fix options:**
  1. Add `status` column to cvs table, persist "processing" state
  2. Maintain queueStore state across project navigation (don't reset)
  3. Show processing indicator on project card in dashboard
- **Tracked for:** Phase 6 or dedicated fix

### Test 7: Sidebar collapse functionality
**Source:** Plan 04 - AppSidebar component

2. Select "Delete" option

**Result:** PASS

---
