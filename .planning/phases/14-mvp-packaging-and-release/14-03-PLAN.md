<objective>
Add a lightweight first-run onboarding experience so testers are not dropped into a blank screen when they first launch the installed app.

Purpose: Without onboarding, new testers won't know what to do. A simple hint overlay dramatically improves first impressions.
Output: An onboarding component shown on first launch (no projects), guiding users to create their first project.

  <name>Task 1: Create first-run onboarding overlay</name>
  <files>src/renderer/components/Onboarding.tsx, src/renderer/App.tsx</files>
  <action>
    NOTE: This plan executes on the `mvp` branch (created by Plan 01). Switch to mvp branch first: `git checkout mvp`.

    1. Create `src/renderer/components/Onboarding.tsx`:
       - A centered overlay/card component shown when no projects exist
       - Content:
         - Welcome heading: "Welcome to Samsara"
         - Brief description: "AI-powered resume editing for recruiters"
         - 3 bullet points explaining core features (CV parsing, JD matching, branded export)
         - A prominent "Create Your First Project" button that triggers the existing new-project flow
         - A "Dismiss" link/button that hides the overlay (stores dismissal in localStorage)
       - Styling: Use existing Tailwind classes consistent with the app's design system
       - The overlay should be a card centered on the page, not a modal blocking everything

    2. Integrate into the app's home/project-list view:
       - In the component that renders the project list (likely App.tsx or a home route), check if projects array is empty AND onboarding hasn't been dismissed
       - If both conditions met, render the Onboarding component
       - The "Create Your First Project" button should call the same handler as the existing "New Project" button
       - After a project is created, the onboarding naturally disappears (projects.length > 0)

    3. Use `localStorage.getItem('samsara-onboarding-dismissed')` for persistence. This is lightweight and appropriate for a single boolean flag.

  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - `grep -r "Onboarding" src/renderer/` shows component import and usage
    - `grep "samsara-onboarding-dismissed" src/renderer/` shows localStorage key
  </verify>
  <done>Onboarding overlay appears when no projects exist, guides user to create first project, can be dismissed, and stays hidden after dismissal or project creation</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- Onboarding component exists and is imported in the project list view
- localStorage key is used for dismissal persistence
</verification>

<success_criteria>
First-time users landing on an empty project list see a welcoming onboarding card with clear next steps. The card disappears permanently after creating a project or clicking dismiss.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/14-mvp-packaging-and-release/14-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
