## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Drag project to sidebar for quick access
expected: From the Dashboard, drag a project card toward the sidebar. The sidebar should show a "Quick Access" drop zone that highlights when you hover over it. Dropping the card pins the project to the sidebar.
result: pass
note: Fixed during testing - changed collision detection from closestCenter to pointerWithin, added select-none to prevent text selection

### 2. Reorder pinned projects via drag-drop
expected: With 2+ projects pinned in the sidebar Quick Access section, drag one pinned project above or below another. The order should update and persist after navigation.
result: pass

### 3. Unpin project via X button
expected: Hover over a pinned project in the sidebar. An X button should appear. Clicking it removes the project from Quick Access.
result: pass

### 4. Token usage in Dashboard stats strip
expected: The stats strip at top of Dashboard shows total token usage with a Gauge icon. Format should be abbreviated (e.g., "12.4K tokens") with cost estimate in cloud mode.
result: pass
note: Fixed during testing - Python sidecar rebuilt to include token_usage in responses, QueueManager updated to record usage

### 5. Token usage on project cards
expected: Each project card shows inline token usage after CV/JD counts, like "5 CVs · 2 JDs · 12.4K (~$0.04)" for cloud mode, or just token count for local mode.
result: pass

### 6. Settings page with usage limits
expected: Click Settings in sidebar. A unified Settings page opens showing LLM configuration and Usage Limits section with preset quick picks (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K).
result: pass

### 7. Toast warning at 80% usage limit
expected: When token usage reaches 80% of the configured limit, a warning toast appears in the bottom-right corner and stays until dismissed.
result: pass

### 8. Hidden scrollbars throughout app
expected: Scroll any scrollable area (project list, CV queue, etc.). Content scrolls normally but no visible scrollbar track/thumb appears.
result: pass
