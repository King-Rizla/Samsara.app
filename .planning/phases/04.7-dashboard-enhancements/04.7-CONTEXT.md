# Phase 4.7: Dashboard Enhancements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Enhance dashboard with project quick-access via drag-drop and token/API usage visibility with configurable limits. Users can pin frequently-used projects to sidebar and monitor their API consumption with warnings when approaching limits.

## Implementation Decisions

### Quick Access behavior
- Drag feedback: Both drop zone highlights AND ghost preview showing where project will land
- Two unpin methods: X button on hover AND drag project back out of sidebar
- No limit on number of pinned projects
- Pinned projects can be reordered via drag-and-drop
- **Global styling rule:** Hidden scrollbars throughout the app (scrollable but no visible scrollbar) - applies to Quick Access and all existing/future scrollable areas

### Usage display style
- Token format: Abbreviated (1.2K, 45.3K, 1.1M) - hover for exact count
- Show cost estimates alongside tokens: "45.3K tokens (~$0.12)"
- Use gauge/meter icon to represent usage
- Project card placement: Inline with CV/JD counts - "5 CVs · 2 JDs · 12.4K (~$0.04)"
- Stats strip shows same format with totals

### Warning presentation
- Warning type: Toast notification (not banner)
- Toast stays until user dismisses it
- Two thresholds: Soft limit at 80% (warning), Hard limit at 100% (blocks processing)
- Warning toast includes clickable link to Settings

### Limits settings UI
- Create unified Settings page accessible from dashboard sidebar
- Aggregate ALL settings (current LLM settings + new usage limits + future settings) into this single page
- Limit input: Preset quick picks (10K, 50K, 100K, 500K) plus custom input field
- Each preset shows cost estimate: "50K (~$0.15)"
- Reset period: Monthly, automatic reset on 1st of month
- Global limits only (not per-project) for v1

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact animation timing for drag-drop feedback
- Toast positioning (top-right, bottom-right, etc.)
- Settings page layout and section ordering
- Scrollbar hiding CSS implementation

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Token counts should display cost next to them just like the header"
- Future consideration: Multiple models and API providers will factor into usage calculations (schema should be extensible)
- Settings should be a single aggregated page, not scattered - "All future settings and current ones will be featured there"

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
