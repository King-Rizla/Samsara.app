# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-23)

**Core value:** Architecture as the Advantage - Zero Latency, Zero Egress, Zero Per-Seat Tax
**Current focus:** Phase 2.1 - LLM Extraction (Local LLM for improved work/education/skills)

## Current Position

Phase: 2.1 of 6 (LLM Extraction)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-25 - Completed 02.1-01-PLAN.md (Ollama Integration Layer)

Progress: [####......] 37% (7/19 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: 1.70 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & Distribution | 3/3 | 58 min | 19 min |
| 2. Parsing Pipeline | 3/3 | 44 min | 15 min |
| 2.1. LLM Extraction | 1/2 | 5 min | 5 min |
| 3. Visual Editor | 0/2 | - | - |
| 4. JD Matching | 0/3 | - | - |
| 5. Anonymization & Branding | 0/3 | - | - |
| 6. Bulk Processing & OS Integration | 0/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 15 min, 7 min, 12 min, 25 min, 5 min
- Trend: Consistent execution, LLM integration faster than expected

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Research]: PyInstaller `--onedir` required (not `--onefile`) for faster startup to meet <2s requirement
- [Research]: spaCy en_core_web_sm model (12MB) for NER, preload at startup
- [Research]: Code signing must happen in Phase 1, not as a last step
- [Questioning]: JD Matching is equally important as formatting - added as Phase 4
- [01-01]: Use concurrent:false in VitePlugin to prevent OOM during builds
- [01-01]: Mark better-sqlite3 as external in Vite rollup options
- [01-01]: WAL mode + synchronous=NORMAL for SQLite performance
- [01-02]: Python 3.12 required - spaCy incompatible with Python 3.14
- [01-02]: Model path detection handles frozen/dev contexts via get_model_path()
- [01-03]: spawn + readline for Python IPC (not python-shell library)
- [01-03]: extraResource for Python sidecar in packaged app
- [02-01]: suppress_stdout() context manager for PyMuPDF to preserve JSON lines IPC
- [02-01]: Multi-column detection via X position gap analysis (>100px threshold)
- [02-01]: Cascading parser strategy: PyMuPDF first, pdfplumber for tables
- [02-02]: British date format with dayfirst=True (3/2/2020 = 3rd Feb)
- [02-02]: Partial dates default to 1st (Jan 2020 -> 01/01/2020)
- [02-02]: Company indicators filtered from PERSON entities (Ltd, Inc, LLC)
- [02-02]: Preserve candidate skill groupings rather than re-categorizing
- [02-03]: webUtils.getPathForFile for context-isolated file access (Electron)
- [02-03]: Native dialog.showOpenDialog as fallback for click-to-select
- [02-03]: 70% confidence threshold for low-confidence field highlighting
- [User]: Local LLM extraction for improved work/education/skills deferred to Phase 2.1
- [02.1-01]: Qwen 2.5 7B default model (Qwen3 breaks JSON with thinking tags)
- [02.1-01]: 60s timeout for extraction, 5m keep_alive to avoid cold-start delays
- [02.1-01]: Never raise exceptions in OllamaClient - return None for fallback

### Pending Todos

- Phase 2.1: Local LLM extraction enhancement (user-decided follow-up)

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research] PDF parsing may fail on 30-40% of real resumes - need adversarial corpus testing
- [Research] macOS Gatekeeper rejects unsigned Python binaries - sign ALL binaries including PyInstaller output
- [02-03] Work history, education, skills extraction quality needs LLM enhancement (Phase 2.1)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-25T11:40:19Z
Stopped at: Completed 02.1-01-PLAN.md (Ollama Integration Layer)
Resume file: None

## Next Steps

**Phase 2.1 Plan 02: Hybrid Integration** — Wire LLM extraction into existing pipeline
- Update work_history.py, education.py, skills.py with LLM-first approach
- Add extraction_method metadata to responses
- Fallback to regex when Ollama unavailable

Run `/gsd:execute-phase 02.1-02` to continue.
